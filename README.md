He will be able to upload the images for the corresponding products. After creation of store, the store details will be stored in a server and any user can access the store by accessing the website URL   and searching the store by location. User will be able to place an order by adding items to cart.
In this way, any user can access the website URL, search for stores based on the location and select a store of their choice and place an order.
