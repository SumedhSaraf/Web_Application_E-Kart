### Project Overview
- The project aims at building an e-commerce platform which will be useful mainly for mid-sized retailers to set up their business. Any retailer who wants to set up his store has to register an account. After creating his account, he should create different sections and departments of his choice and add the products of his store corresponding to the department. He will be able to upload the images for the corresponding products. After creation of store, the store details will be stored in a server and any user can access the store by accessing the website URL   and searching the store by location. User will be able to place an order by adding items to cart.
In this way, any user can access the website URL, search for stores based on the location and select a store of their choice and place an order.
